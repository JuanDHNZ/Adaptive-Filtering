Description   :
    Duffing map. It is a discrete-time dynamical system (2nd order)
    The map depends on the two constants: a and b.
    Z coordinate is a linear function.

    Duffing equations are:
    Eq. 1:
        dx/dt = y
        dy/dt = -a*y - x**3 + b * cos(z)
        dz/dt = 1
    where a = 0.1 and b = 11 (default parameters)

    Eq. 2:
        dx/dt = y
        dy/dt = a*y - y**3 - b*x
        dz/dt = 1
    where a = 2.75 and b = 0.2 (default parameters)
