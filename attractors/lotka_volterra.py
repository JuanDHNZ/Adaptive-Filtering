Description   :
    The Lotka–Volterra equations, also known as the predator–prey
    equations.

    Chaotic Lotka-Volterra model require a careful tuning of
    parameters and are even less likely to exhibit chaos as the number
    of species increases.

    Lotka–Volterra equations are:
    Eq. 1:
        dx/dt = x * (1 - x - 9*y)
        dy/dt = -y * (1 - 6*x - y + 9*z)
        dz/dt = z * (1 - 3*x - z)

    Be careful! Init parameters of x, y, z should be set right.

    For example, [x, y, z] = [0.6; 0.2; 0.01]
