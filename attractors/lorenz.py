Description   :
    Lorenz attractor is ordinary differential equation (ODE) of
    3rd order system.
    In 1963, E. Lorenz developed a simplified mathematical model for
    atmospheric convection.

    Lorenz equations are:
        dx/dt = sigma * (y - x)
        dy/dt = rho * x - y - x * z
        dz/dt = x * y - beta * z

    where beta, rho and sigma - are Lorenz system parameters. Default
    values are: beta = 8/3, rho = 28 and sigma = 10.

    Wiki: If rho < 1 then there is only one equilibrium point.
