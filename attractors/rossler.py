Description   :
    Rossler attractor is the attractor for the Rössler system. Rossler
    attractor is a system of three non-linear ordinary differential
    equations.

    Rossler equations are:
        dx/dt = -(y + z)
        dy/dt = x + a * y
        dz/dt = b + z * (x - c)

    where a, b and sigma - are Rossler system parameters. Default
    values are: a = 0.2, b = 0.2 and c = 5.7.

    1) a = 0.2, b = 0.2 and c = 5.7 (Standard model)
    2) a = 0.1, b = 0.1 and c = 14 (another useful parameters)
    3) a = 0.5, b = 1.0 and c = 3 (J. C. Sprott)

    Wiki (Varying parameters);

    Varying a:
    b = 0.2 and c = 5.7 are fixed. Change a:

    a <= 0	    : Converges to the centrally located fixed point
    a = 0.1	    : Unit cycle of period 1
    a = 0.2	    : Standard parameter value selected by Rössler, chaotic
    a = 0.3     : Chaotic attractor, significantly more Möbius strip-like
                (folding over itself).
    a = 0.35    : Similar to .3, but increasingly chaotic
    a = 0.38    : Similar to .35, but increasingly chaotic

    Varying b:
    a = 0.2 and c = 5.7 are fixed. Change b:

    If b approaches 0 the attractor approaches infinity, but if b would
    be more than a and c, system becomes not a chaotic.

    Varying c:
    a = b = 0.1 are fixed. Change c:

    c = 4       : period-1 orbit,
    c = 6       : period-2 orbit,
    c = 8.5     : period-4 orbit,
    c = 8.7     : period-8 orbit,
    c = 9       : sparse chaotic attractor,
    c = 12      : period-3 orbit,
    c = 12.6    : period-6 orbit,
    c = 13      : sparse chaotic attractor,
    c = 18      : filled-in chaotic attractor.
