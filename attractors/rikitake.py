Description   :
    Rikitake system is ordinary differential equation (ODE) of
    3rd order system.
    Rikitake system attempts to explain the reversal of the Earthâ€™s
    magnetic field.

    Rikitake equations are:
        dx/dt = -mu * x + z * y
        dy/dt = -mu * y + x * (z - a)
        dz/dt = 1 - x * y

    where a, mu - are Rikitake system parameters. Default values are
    a = 5, mu = 2 or a = mu = 1.
