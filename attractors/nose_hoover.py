Description   :
    Nose–Hoover oscillator is ordinary differential equation (ODE) of
    3rd order system.
    Nose–Hoover system has only five terms and two quadratic
    nonlinearities.

    Nose–Hoover equations are:
        dx/dt = y
        dy/dt = y * z - x
        dz/dt = 1 - y * y

    Nose–Hoover system doesn't have any system parameters.
